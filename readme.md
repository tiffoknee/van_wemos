Wemos Pro based solution for recording temperature and humidity data, running fans automatically based on the data, and feeding back with LEDs.

Note: if the RGBs do not respond, but they work fine on an arduino, update your adafruit_neopixel library. You may have an old version that doesn't support ESP8266.
